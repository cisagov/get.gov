The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) manages the .gov top-level domain. **Get.gov won't collect personal data about you unless you choose to provide it**. We only collect information that helps us make get.gov better for all visitors.

## Information we collect

We automatically collect and store the following information:

- The date and time of your visit
- The pages you visit on get.gov
- Search terms that you enter into the get.gov search box
- The web address of the site you came from, if the referring site links to get.gov and shares that information

## Information you send us

We only use the personal information you share with us to respond to you. Information you send won't be available in, or saved by, web tracking software. Unless required by law enforcement or statute, we don't disclose, give, sell, or transfer any personal information about our visitors.

### Domain registration information

Registration for .gov domains requires contact information for registrants. We offer a .gov WHOIS service. WHOIS (pronounced “who is”) is a standard used by registrars to publish information about registered domains. Though our WHOIS includes fields for names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, and name server addresses, we only publish name server addresses and optionally a security contact email address (if the registrant provides one).
