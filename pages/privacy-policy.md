**We won't collect personal data about you unless you choose to provide it**. We only collect statistical information that helps us make get<span>.gov</span> better for all visitors.

## Information we collect

We automatically collect and store the following information:

- The name of the domain from which you access the internet (e.g., DHS<span>.gov</span> if you connect from a U.S. Department of Homeland Security account, or GMU<span>.edu</span> if you connect from George Mason University’s domain)
- The date and time of your visit
- The pages you visit on get<span>.gov</span>
- Search terms that you enter into the get<span>.gov</span> search box
- The internet address of the website you came from if it linked you directly to get<span>.gov</span> and if the referring website shares that information
- If your browser accepts cookies, we may use a session cookie to learn how different visitors come to get<span>.gov</span>.

## Information you send us

If you send us personal information in an email or by filling out a form, we'll only use that information to respond to you. Information you send won't be available in, or saved by, web tracking software. We may forward your email to the government employee who can best answer your question. Unless required by law enforcement or statute, we don't disclose, give, sell, or transfer any personal information about our visitors.

### Domain registration information

Registration for .gov domains requires contact information for registrants. To support internet security, we’re required to offer the WHOIS service for the .gov top-level domain. This service allows anyone to check domain name availability and view contact information for domain registrants. The WHOIS data can include the registrant’s name, contact person’s name, address, telephone number, email address, and IP address. Through the WHOIS service, this information may be disclosed to unaffiliated third parties to determine the registrant or the registrar in case of:

- Technical problems that might occur when accessing its domain
- Assisting law enforcement authorities in investigations, crime prevention, and matters of national security
- Helping to counter the infringement of third-party legal rights
- Preventing fraud

## Security
We take steps to ensure that this site is safe, secure, and available for all users. We use industry-standard methods to monitor network traffic on CISA servers (owned or contracted). We watch for unauthorized attempts to upload or change information, or otherwise cause damage. Unauthorized attempts to upload or change information on CISA servers are prohibited and may be punishable by law, including the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986 and the National Information Infrastructure Protection Act.
