It's important to keep information about your .gov domain, your organization, and your contacts updated. 

If you don’t already have a Login.gov account, you’ll need to create one to change any information about your .gov domain. [Create a Login.gov account](https://login.gov/help/get-started/create-your-account/){.usa-link--external}.

## Add a domain manager to your .gov domain

Domain managers can update all information related to a domain within the .gov registrar, including contact details, senior official, security email, and DNS name servers. There is no limit to the number of domain managers you can add.

2. Click the “Manage” link for your .gov domain.
3. Click “Domain managers” on the left-side navigation.

## Manage DNS name servers

The Domain Name System (DNS) is the internet service that translates your domain name into an IP address. This makes it possible for people to access your online service by using a name instead of a numbered address.

Before your approved .gov domain can be used, [you’ll first need to connect it to a DNS hosting service](../../domains/moving/#find-dns-hosting-services). After you’ve set up hosting, you’ll need to enter your name server information on the .gov registrar. Name server records indicate which DNS server is authoritative for your domain. You must add at least two name servers (13 max).

1. Sign in to the [.gov registrar](https://manage.get.gov){target="_blank"} using your Login.gov account.
2. Click the “Manage” link for your .gov domain.
3. Click “Name servers” (under “DNS”) on the left-side navigation.
4. Enter your name servers in the required format using only supported characters (letters [A-Z], numbers [0-9], the minus sign [-], and the period [.]).
5. Click “Save.”

If you self-host your DNS or use custom addresses for your name server, you will need to add IP addresses for each name server in either the IPv4 or IPv6 format (multiple IP addresses must be separated with commas).

## Enable DNSSEC on your domain

DNSSEC, or DNS Security Extensions, is an additional security layer to protect your website. Enabling DNSSEC ensures that when someone visits your domain, they can be certain that it’s connecting to the correct server, preventing potential hijacking or tampering with your domain's records. 

<strong>Note: It is strongly recommended that you only enable DNSSEC if you know how to set it up properly at your hosting service. If you make a mistake, it could cause your domain name to stop working.</strong>

1. Sign in to the [.gov registrar](https://manage.get.gov){target="_blank"} using your Login.gov account.
2. Click the “Manage” link for your .gov domain.
3. Click “DNSSEC” (under “DNS”) on the left-side navigation.
4. Click “Enable DNSSEC.”
5. Enter the values given by your DNS provider for DS data.
6. If you need to add more than one DS record, click “Add new record,” which appears below the form fields.
7. Click “Save.”

## Disable DNSSEC on your domain

1. Sign in to the [.gov registrar](https://manage.get.gov){target="_blank"} using your Login.gov account.
2. Click the “Manage” link for your .gov domain.
3. Click “DNSSEC” (under “DNS”) on the left-side navigation.
4. Click “Disable DNSSEC.”
5. Click “Confirm.”
6. Wait until the Time to Live (TTL) expires on your DNSSEC records managed by your DNS hosting provider. This is often less than 24 hours, but confirm with your provider.
7. After the TTL expiration, disable DNSSEC at your DNS hosting provider.

<strong>Warning: if you disable DNSSEC at your DNS hosting provider before TTL expiration, this may cause your domain to appear offline.</strong>
