## Manage DNS information for your domain

A name server is a server within the Domain Name System (DNS) that answers queries about a domain name. DNS is the internet service that translates your domain name into an IP address. This makes it possible for people to access your online service by using a name instead of a numbered address. Before your approved .gov domain can be used, you’ll need to connect it to your DNS hosting service. You’ll also need to enter your name server information on the .gov domain management site. Follow the steps below to do that.
