## How much does a .gov domain cost? 
.Gov domains are **FREE**! Learn how to get a [free .gov domain](https://get.gov/domains/before/).

## I need to add or remove someone from my domain.
You can add or remove domain managers without contacting us. 

1. Sign in to the [.gov registrar](https://manage.get.gov){target="_blank"} using your Login.gov account.
2. Click the “Manage” link for your .gov domain.
3. Click “Domain managers” on the left-side navigation.
4. Add or remove domain managers as needed.

## I don’t see my domain when I sign in to the registrar.
If you had a .gov account prior to November 2023, **you can’t use your old credentials to access the new registrar**. You’ll need to [create a Login.gov account](https://login.gov/help/get-started/create-your-account/){.usa-link--external} with the same email address you used to sign in to the old registrar. That will ensure that you have access to your domains.

If you need help finding the email address you used in the past, email us at help@help.gov.

## I need to renew my domain. / My domain is about to expire.
As part of launching our new registrar, we extended expiration dates for .gov domains in good standing for one year. **Domains in good standing will not expire before November 1, 2024**. 

If you received an email that your domain is about to expire, that notification is outdated. We are rebuilding our renewal/expiration process. We’ll keep domain managers updated on our progress.

## I'm working with a government organization. Why do I have to provide personal information to request a domain for them?
To ensure that only U.S.-based governments get .gov domains, we verify the identity of every new domain requestor. We do this to:
- Discourage ineligible organizations from requesting a domain.
- Gain assurance that a person who claims to represent a government is who they say they are.

The state of the art in identity verification is to use attested information (like a license or a SSN). This is why we use Login.gov. However, there is no technology to confirm that a person actually represents a government organization. We manually verify that claim as part of our investigation. 

## Can I request a name like cityname.state.gov (e.g., detroit.mi.gov)?
The “cityname” and “detroit” part of the examples above are subdomains. **We do not manage subdomains for .gov**. 

To use a subdomain for a particular .gov domain, like mi.gov, you need to coordinate with the registrant for that .gov domain. View [data for all .gov domains](https://get.gov/about/data/), including points of contact for domains.
