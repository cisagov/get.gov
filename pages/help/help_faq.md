## How much does a .gov domain cost? {#gov-domains-are-free}
For eligible government organizations, .gov domains are **FREE**! Learn how to get a [free .gov domain](../../domains/before/). 

## I'm working with a government organization. Why do I have to provide personal information to request a domain on their behalf? {#working-with-a-gov-org}
Since most governments in the U.S. operate transparently, it’s usually not difficult to discover information about an organization. Anyone can easily find the names, roles, or email addresses of those employed, or details like official records, budgets, or a tax ID. However, it can be difficult to know whether someone approaching us actually is who they say they are, or that they really represent their purported organization.

To prevent someone from using public information to impersonate a government or an official, as well as discourage unauthorized individuals or ineligible organizations from requesting a domain, we verify the identity of new domain requestors using Login.gov. Once your identity has been confirmed, we then conduct a manual review to assess whether you actually work for, or on behalf of, a government.

Login.gov is a secure, government website that adheres to the highest standards in data protection. Most of the data you submit is not stored. You can learn more about the [privacy and security measures](https://login.gov/policy/){.usa-link--external}{target="_blank"} taken to keep your information safe.

## Can I request a name like cityname.state.gov (e.g., detroit.mi.gov)? {#subdomain}
The “cityname” and “detroit” part of the examples above are subdomains. **We do not register subdomains for .gov**. 

To use a subdomain for a particular .gov domain, like mi.gov, you need to coordinate with the registrant for that .gov domain. View [data for all .gov domains](../../about/data/), including points of contact for domains.

## How many domains can I request? {#one-domain}

For non-federal agencies, we generally approve one domain per online service per government organization. We'll evaluate additional requests on a case-by-case basis.

Approval of an additional domain intended to be used for the same purpose as an existing domain may be conditioned upon the return of the original domain. We may allow a period of overlapping registration, which typically will not last longer than a year.

## I want prevent others from taking my organization's name. Is that allowed? {#defensive-registration}

No. You don’t need to defensively register names that you hold in other top-level domains, and you don't need to defensively register variations of an existing .gov registration.

Unlike other top-level domains, the .gov namespace is not first come, first served. We'll only register a domain to the organization whose real name or services actually correspond to the domain name. In this way, choosing to _not_ register a domain protects it even better than registering it.

## How much longer until I hear back about a domain request? {#domain-request-status}
Our review process usually takes about 10 business days, but it can take longer depending on the details of your request. 

You can [check the status of the domain request at any time](../domain-requests/#check-the-status-of-your-domain-request). If you have a question, [contact us](../../contact/). 

Learn more about [what happens after you request a .gov domain](../../domains/before/#what-happens-after-you-request-your-gov-domain).

## How do I add or remove someone from a domain? {#add-or-remove-from-domain}
You can add or remove domain managers without contacting us. 

1. Sign in to the [.gov registrar](https://manage.get.gov){target="_blank"} using your Login.gov account.
2. Click the “Manage” link for your .gov domain.
3. Click “Domain managers” on the left-side navigation.
4. Add or remove domain managers as needed. 

Get more help [adding or removing domain managers](../domain-management/#add-a-domain-manager-to-your-gov-domain).

## Why don't I see a domain when I sign in to the registrar? {#do-not-see-my-domain}
The domain is closely tied to the email address you use when signing in to the .gov registrar.

**If you had a .gov account prior to November 2023**:  We launched a new .gov registrar. When signing in, you need to use a [Login.gov account](https://login.gov/help/get-started/create-your-account/){.usa-link--external}{target="_blank"} that’s associated with the same email address you used to sign in to the old registrar. That will ensure you have access to your existing domain. 

**If you have more than one Login.gov account, or have more than one email address associated with your Login.gov account:**: When signing in to the .gov registrar, you need to use the [Login.gov account](https://login.gov/help/get-started/create-your-account/){.usa-link--external} that’s associated with the email address your .gov domain is assigned to.  
- If you have more than one Login.gov account, try [signing in](https://manage.get.gov/){target="_blank"} with each account.
- If you have more than one email address associated with your Login.gov account, [change the email address shared with the registrar](https://www.login.gov/help/manage-your-account/change-partner-email-address/#how-do-i-manage-which-email-gets-shared-with-any-partner-agency-i-have-connected-with){.usa-link--external}{target="_blank"}. 
- We recommend adding your work email to your Login.gov account [and sharing the work email with the registrar](https://www.login.gov/help/manage-your-account/change-partner-email-address/#how-do-i-manage-which-email-gets-shared-with-any-partner-agency-i-have-connected-with){.usa-link--external}{target="_blank"} (“get.gov”).

**If someone invited you to manage a domain**: Confirm which email address the domain invitation was sent to. When signing in to the .gov registrar, you need to use a [Login.gov account](https://login.gov/help/get-started/create-your-account/){.usa-link--external}{target="_blank"} that’s associated with the same email address that was invited. You may need to ask the person who sent the invitation to send another one to your preferred email address.

If you’ve tried the above recommendations and still don’t see the domain, [contact us](../../contact/).

## A domain will expire soon. How can I renew it? {#renew-domain}
You can renew a domain in the [.gov registrar](https://manage.get.gov/){target="_blank"} starting 60 days before expiration. All domain managers can renew a domain. Learn more about [how to renew a domain](../domain-management/#renew-an-expiring-or-expired-gov-domain/).

After renewal, the domain is registered for another year. 

Email notifications for expiring domains are sent to domain managers 30 days, 7 days, and 1 day before the expiration date.

## What happens if I don’t renew a domain? {#dont-renew}
* _If a domain expires and has DNS name servers_: We’ll make an extensive effort to contact your organization before placing the domain on hold or deleting it. The domain can be renewed until our team deletes it.
* _If a domain expires and does not have DNS name servers_: The domain will be deleted immediately. 

## Where can I add DNS records? {#dns-records}
To add or update DNS records like A, MX, CNAME, or TXT, you need to make changes at your DNS hosting provider. We don’t offer [DNS hosting services](../../domains/moving/#find-dns-hosting-services) at this time. Your provider operates the domain’s name servers, which appear as NS records in the .gov registrar.

If you’re unsure who your DNS hosting provider is, sign in to the .gov registrar and review the domain’s NS records. These are your name servers, which are managed by your hosting provider. The domain in the NS record is often the name of the website where you can update your DNS records.

## My DNS hosting provider wants me to transfer my .gov domain to their registrar. What should I do? {#transfer-domain}
**A .gov domain cannot be transferred to any other registrar**. However, DNS for the domain can be managed by a third party, and as some DNS hosting providers operate registrars, their help desk or documentation may not clearly reflect the unique case of .gov domains.

If you are asked for an AUTH code by your DNS hosting provider, let them know that you’re trying to set up DNS hosting and that you cannot transfer a .gov domain to them.

## Where do I get a .gov email address? {#email-address}
We don't offer email hosting services. Once you have a .gov domain registered and a [DNS provider hosting the domain](../../domains/moving/#find-dns-hosting-services), you can work with an email services provider or manage your own email infrastructure. Your DNS hosting provider may offer email services.

If your organization already has email operating on a non-.gov domain, you may be able to [move it to a .gov domain](../../domains/moving/#plan-to-move-your-email-to-gov).

## Your policies prohibit using a .gov domain for “commercial purposes." What does that mean? {#commercial-purposes}
The [DOTGOV Act of 2020](https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=(title:6%20section:665%20edition:prelim)%20OR%20(granuleid:USC-prelim-title6-section665)&f=treesort&edition=prelim&num=0&jumpTo=true){.usa-link--external}{target="_blank"} states that .gov domains “may not be used for commercial … purposes.” This means a .gov domain may not be used for purposes that would solely promote a commercial entity or their activities. For example, a .gov website should not include promotional space that can be directly purchased (e.g., web advertising). However, a .gov domain can be used in ways that promote commerce where such promotion primarily serves a public purpose rather than private interests. As appropriate, this might include the names or logos of private enterprises on a .gov website. 

Not all government activities that involve money constitute “commercial purposes." For example, a state Department of Motor Vehicles could use a .gov domain to collect payment for license renewals. Payment for government services, or for the entity’s own fundraising (as appropriate), would not constitute “commercial purposes." 

**Prohibited commercial uses include**: 
* Displaying sponsored content or advertising, paid for by commercial entities, without a clear public purpose (e.g., banner ads) 
* Hosting commercial activity for non-government business (e.g., online shops, casinos) 

**Acceptable uses include**: 
* Providing links to, or sharing information about, essential services or public events hosted on a commercial entity’s platform. This includes:
  * Sharing links to or embedding your organization’s social media accounts
  * Directing the public to a third-party vendor that provides services on behalf of the organization.
  * Naming, sharing the branding of, or providing contact details for commercial organizations that offer services to the public, like urgent care, utilities, lodging, or cultural events
* Fundraising, or soliciting contributions, for a public purpose (as appropriate)
* Promoting or hosting promotional materials (e.g., fliers, social media posts) for public events 
* Referencing commercial partnerships held by the government organization 
* Conducting the functions for publicly controlled enterprises, like fairs, theaters, zoos, or auctions 
* Publishing third-party news about important events affecting the public 

Your organization may need to comply with additional requirements around "commercial purposes" that impact what you can promote online (e.g., state law, organizational policies).
