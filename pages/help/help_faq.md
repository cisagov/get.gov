## How much does a .gov domain cost? 
For eligible government organizations, .gov domains are **FREE**! Learn how to get a [free .gov domain](https://get.gov/domains/before/).

<span id="working-with-a-gov-org"></span>
## I'm working with a government organization. Why do I have to provide personal information to request a domain on their behalf?
Since most governments in the U.S. operate transparently, it’s usually not difficult to discover information about an organization. Anyone can easily find the names, roles, or email addresses of those employed, or details like official records, budgets, or a tax ID. However, it can be difficult to know whether someone approaching us actually is who they say they are, or that they really represent their purported organization.

To prevent someone from using public information to impersonate a government or an official, as well as discourage unauthorized individuals or ineligible organizations from requesting a domain, we verify the identity of new domain requestors using Login.gov. Once your identity has been confirmed, we then conduct a manual review to assess whether you actually work for, or on behalf of, a government.

Login.gov is a secure, government website that adheres to the highest standards in data protection. Most of the data you submit is not stored. You can learn more about the [privacy and security measures](https://login.gov/policy/){.usa-link--external} taken to keep your information safe.

<span id="subdomain"></span>
## Can I request a name like cityname.state.gov (e.g., detroit.mi.gov)?
The “cityname” and “detroit” part of the examples above are subdomains. **We do not register subdomains for .gov**. 

To use a subdomain for a particular .gov domain, like mi.gov, you need to coordinate with the registrant for that .gov domain. View [data for all .gov domains](https://get.gov/about/data/), including points of contact for domains.

<span id="domain-request-status"></span>
## How much longer until I hear back about my domain request?
Our review process can take 30 business days. Due to the volume of requests, the wait time is longer than usual. It also may take longer depending on the details of your request. 

You can [check the status of your domain request at any time](https://get.gov/help/domain-requests/#check-the-status-of-your-domain-request). If you have a question, [contact us](https://get.gov/contact/).

<span id="add-or-remove-from-domain"></span>
## How do I add or remove someone from my domain?
You can add or remove domain managers without contacting us.

2. Click the “Manage” link for your .gov domain.
3. Click “Domain managers” on the left-side navigation.

<span id="do-not-see-my-domain"></span>
## Why don't I see my domain when I sign in to the registrar?
Your domain is closely tied to the email address you use when signing in to the .gov registrar.

**If you had a .gov account prior to November 2023**:  We launched a new .gov registrar. When signing in, you need to use a [Login.gov account](https://login.gov/help/get-started/create-your-account/){.usa-link--external} that’s associated with the same email address you used to sign in to the old registrar. That will ensure you have access to your existing domain. 

**If you have more than one Login.gov account, or have more than one email address associated with your Login.gov account**: When signing in to the .gov registrar, you need to use the [Login.gov account](https://login.gov/help/get-started/create-your-account/){.usa-link--external} that’s associated with the email address your .gov domain is assigned to. 
- If you have more than one Login.gov account, try [signing in](https://manage.get.gov/){target="_blank"}  with each account.
- If you have more than one email address associated with your Login.gov account, try [signing in](https://manage.get.gov/){target="_blank"}  with a different email address. 
- We recommend using a Login.gov account that is only linked to your work email.

**If someone invited you to manage a domain**: Confirm which email address your domain invitation was sent to. When signing in to the .gov registrar, you need to use a [Login.gov account](https://login.gov/help/get-started/create-your-account/){.usa-link--external} that’s associated with the same email address that was invited. You may need to ask the person who sent the invitation to send another one to your preferred email address.

If you’ve tried the above recommendations and still don’t see your domain, email us at <help@get.gov>.


<span id="renew-domain"></span>
## My domain is about to expire. How can I renew my domain?
As part of launching our new registrar, we extended expiration dates for .gov domains in good standing for one year. **Domains in good standing will not expire before November 1, 2024**. 

If you received an email that your domain is about to expire, that notification is outdated. We are rebuilding our renewal/expiration process. We’ll keep domain managers updated on our progress. 

<span id="dns-records"></span>
## Where can I add DNS records?
To add or update DNS records like A, MX, CNAME, or TXT, you need to make changes at your DNS hosting provider. We don’t offer [DNS hosting services](https://get.gov/domains/moving/#find-dns-hosting-services) at this time. Your provider operates your domain’s name servers, which appear as NS records in the .gov registrar.

If you’re unsure who your DNS hosting provider is, sign in to the .gov registrar and review your domain’s NS records. These are your name servers, which are managed by your hosting provider. The domain in the NS record is often the name of the website where you can update your DNS records.

<span id="transfer-domain"></span>
## My DNS hosting provider wants me to transfer my .gov domain to their registrar. What should I do?
**A .gov domain cannot be transferred to any other registrar**. However, DNS for the domain can be managed by a third party, and as some DNS hosting providers operate registrars, their help desk or documentation may not clearly reflect the unique case of .gov domains.

If you are asked for an AUTH code by your DNS hosting provider, let them know that you’re trying to set up DNS hosting and that you cannot transfer a .gov domain to them.

<span id="commercial-purposes"></span>
## Your policies prohibit using a .gov domain for “commercial purposes." What does that mean?
The [DOTGOV Act of 2020](https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=(title:6%20section:665%20edition:prelim)%20OR%20(granuleid:USC-prelim-title6-section665)&f=treesort&edition=prelim&num=0&jumpTo=true){.usa-link--external} states that .gov domains “may not be used for commercial … purposes.” This means a .gov domain may not be used for purposes that would solely promote a commercial entity or their activities. For example, a .gov website should not include promotional space that can be directly purchased (e.g., web advertising). However, a .gov domain can be used in ways that promote commerce where such promotion primarily serves a public purpose rather than private interests. As appropriate, this might include the names or logos of private enterprises on a .gov website. 

Not all government activities that involve money constitute “commercial purposes." For example, a state Department of Motor Vehicles could use a .gov domain to collect payment for license renewals. Payment for government services, or for the entity’s own fundraising (as appropriate), would not constitute “commercial purposes." 

**Prohibited commercial uses include**: 
* Displaying sponsored content or advertising, paid for by commercial entities, without a clear public purpose (e.g., banner ads) 
* Hosting commercial activity for non-government business (e.g., online shops, casinos) 

**Acceptable uses include**: 
* Providing links to, or sharing information about, essential services or public events hosted on a commercial entity’s platform. This includes:
  * Sharing links to or embedding your organization’s social media accounts
  * Directing the public to a third-party vendor that provides services on behalf of the organization.
  * Naming, sharing the branding of, or providing contact details for commercial organizations that offer services to the public, like urgent care, utilities, lodging, or cultural events
* Fundraising, or soliciting contributions, for a public purpose (as appropriate)
* Promoting or hosting promotional materials (e.g., fliers, social media posts) for public events 
* Referencing commercial partnerships held by the government organization 
* Conducting the functions for publicly controlled enterprises, like fairs, theaters, zoos, or auctions 
* Publishing third-party news about important events affecting the public 

Your organization may need to comply with additional requirements around "commercial purposes" that impact what you can promote online (e.g., state law, organizational policies).
