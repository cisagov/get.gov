## Access the .gov registrar

### New registrar requires Login.gov account

In November 2023, we launched a new .gov registrar. You must have a Login.gov account to request or manage domains in this new registrar. Login.gov provides a simple and secure process for signing in to many government services with one account. 

### If you had an account in the old .gov registrar

If you had a .gov account prior to November 2023, you can’t use your old credentials to access the new registrar. You’ll need to create a Login.gov account with the same email address you used to log in to the old registrar. That will ensure that you have access to your domains. 

If you need help finding the email address you used in the past, [contact us](../../contact/).

### Update your username and password

Access to the .gov registrar is managed through Login.gov. To update your username and password, you’ll need to do that through your Login.gov account. Follow these steps to [update your username and password](https://www.login.gov/help/manage-your-account/change-your-password/){.usa-link--external}.

## Update your contact information (email, phone)

Updating your contact information for one domain will update the contact information for all domains in your account. However, it won’t affect your Login.gov account information.

The contact information you provide won’t be made public and will only be used for the .gov program.

1. Sign in to the [.gov registrar](https://manage.get.gov){target="_blank"} using your Login.gov account.
3. Click the “Manage” link for your .gov domain.
4. Click “Your contact information” on the left-side navigation.
5. Update your contact information.
6. Click “Save.”
