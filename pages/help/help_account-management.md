## Get help with your Login.gov account

### You must have a Login.gov account to request or manage .gov domains

We use Login.gov to make signing in easier and more secure. If you don’t have a Login.gov account you’ll need to create one to request a .gov domain or to manage existing .gov domains. 

### About Login.gov

Login.gov provides a simple and secure process for signing into many government services with one account. Participating agencies ask you to create a Login.gov account to securely access their websites or applications. Login.gov is managed by the U.S. General Services Administration.

### You must verify your identity with Login.gov

We require you to verify your identity with Login.gov. This is an extra layer of security that requires you to prove you are you, and not someone pretending to be you.

After you verify your identity with Login.gov for one government application, you don’t need to do it again for other government applications that use Login.gov and require identity verification.
