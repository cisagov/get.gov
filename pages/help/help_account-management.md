## Access the .gov registrar

You must have a [Login.gov account](https://login.gov/){.usa-link--external} to request or manage domains in the new registrar. Login.gov provides a simple and secure process for signing in to many government services with one account. 

### If you had an account in the old .gov registrar

If you had a .gov account prior to November 2023, you can’t use your old credentials to access the new registrar. You’ll need to [create a Login.gov account](https://login.gov/help/get-started/create-your-account/){.usa-link--external} with the same email address you used to sign in to the old registrar. That will ensure that you have access to your domains. 

If you need help finding the email address you used in the past, [contact us](../../contact/).

### How to create a Login.gov account

[Go to Login.gov to create your account](https://login.gov/help/get-started/create-your-account/){.usa-link--external}. We recommend that you:

- Use your work email address to create your Login.gov account. Don’t use a shared inbox, team email, or distribution address.
- Add two authentication methods to your account. If you lose access to your primary authentication method (e.g. losing your phone), you’ll have a backup. You’ll be asked to set up authentication methods during the Login.gov account creation process.

### If you already have a Login.gov account

If you have a Login.gov account associated with a different email from the one you used in the registrar, we recommend creating another Login.gov account with the registrar email address. (You can add your work email address to your existing Login.gov account, though your organization may have policies against using personal accounts.)

If you plan to request a .gov domain you’ll need to verify your identity with Login.gov if you haven’t already done so.

{% include 'content-blocks/login-verify-identity.md' %}

Not all government services that use Login.gov require this type of verification, but you only need to do it once and it will apply to all government services that require it. 

### If you delete your Login.gov account

If you don’t have access to your [Login.gov authentication methods](https://login.gov/help/get-started/authentication-methods/){.usa-link--external}, you may be advised to [delete your Login.gov account](https://www.login.gov/help/manage-your-account/delete-your-account/){.usa-link--external}. This will cause you to lose access to your domains. 

To regain access to your domains: 
1. Create a new Login.gov account.
2. Ask another manager on your domain to remove and re-add you in the .gov registrar. 

If you don’t have another domain manager, [contact us](../../contact/) to let us know you deleted your Login.gov account.  

## Change your password

Access to the .gov registrar is managed through Login.gov. You can [change your password at Login.gov](https://www.login.gov/help/manage-your-account/change-your-password/){.usa-link--external}.

## Update your contact information

We [require](https://get.gov/domains/requirements/#what-gov-domain-registrants-must-do) that you maintain accurate contact information. The details you provide will only be used to support the administration of .gov and won’t be made public. 

### Name, role, or phone number

To update your name, role, or phone number, visit your profile in the .gov registrar. 

1. Sign in to the [.gov registrar](https://manage.get.gov){target="_blank"} using your Login.gov account.
2. Click the “Your profile” link in the header.
3. Update your name, role, or phone number.
4. Click “Save.”

Updating this information in your profile won’t affect your Login.gov account information.

### Email address

To update your email address, visit your account on Login.gov. 

We recommend **using a Login.gov account that’s only connected to your work email address** and no other address. However, we recognize that may not be flexible enough for each use case. Here are three options that describe how to ensure your desired email address is the one associated with your registered domains:

#### Option 1: Sign in with a different email address that’s associated with your Login.gov account

A Login.gov account may have multiple email addresses associated with it, but your .gov profile only reflects the one you use to sign in. If the email address listed on your .gov profile is not the one you’d like to use: 
1. Navigate to your [Login.gov account](https://secure.login.gov/account/connected_accounts){.usa-link--external} and verify that your desired email address is listed. If it’s not listed, add it.
2. Then, sign in to the [.gov registrar](https://manage.get.gov/){target="_blank"} using your desired email address.
3. After signing in to the registrar, you can immediately sign out. That’s all it takes to change the email address associated with your profile. However, on future sign-ins, you’ll need to use that same email address. 

#### Option 2: Remove other email addresses from your Login.gov account

You can remove other email addresses associated with your Login.gov account, leaving only your desired email address. However, that may impact other government services you access using your Login.gov account. (If that’s not acceptable, you should consider Option 3 below.) To remove other email addresses:

1. Navigate to your [Login.gov account](https://secure.login.gov/account/connected_accounts){.usa-link--external} and review “Your connected accounts”.
2. Verify that you’re comfortable with these accounts having access to a single email address.
3. Add your desired email address if it’s not already listed.
4. Delete any other email addresses. 

#### Option 3: Create a new Login.gov account using only your desired email address

1. Create a new [Login.gov account](https://login.gov/create-an-account/){.usa-link--external} and add your desired email address. 
    - If this email address is associated with another Login.gov account, you’ll need to remove it from that account first.
2. Then, sign in to the [.gov registrar](https://manage.get.gov){target="_blank"} and verify your identity. Identity verification is required each time a new Login.gov account accesses the registrar.
3. After you’ve signed in, [contact us](../../contact) and we’ll associate your new account with your domain.
