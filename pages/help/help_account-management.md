## Access the .gov registrar

### New registrar requires Login.gov account

In November 2023, we launched a new .gov registrar. You must have a Login.gov account to request or manage domains in this new registrar. Login.gov provides a simple and secure process for signing in to many government services with one account. 

### If you had an account in the old .gov registrar

If you had a .gov account prior to November 2023, you can’t use your old credentials to access the new registrar. You’ll need to create a Login.gov account with the same email address you used to sign in to the old registrar. That will ensure that you have access to your domains. 

If you need help finding the email address you used in the past, [contact us](../../contact/).

## Get help with Login.gov

### How to create a Login.gov account

[Go to Login.gov to create your account](https://login.gov/help/get-started/create-your-account/){.usa-link--external}. We recommend that you:

- Use your work email address to create your Login.gov account. Don’t use a shared inbox, team email, or distribution address.
- Add two authentication methods to your account. If you lose access to your primary authentication method (e.g. losing your phone), you’ll have a backup. You’ll be asked to set up authentication methods during the Login.gov account creation process.

### If you already have a Login.gov account

If you have a Login.gov account associated with a different email from the one you used in the registrar, we recommend creating another Login.gov account with the registrar email address. (You can add your work email address to your existing Login.gov account, though your organization may have policies against using personal accounts.)

If you plan to request a .gov domain, you’ll need to verify your identity with Login.gov if you haven’t already done so.

Not all government services that use Login.gov require this type of verification, but you only need to do it once and it will apply to all government services that require it. Read more about [verifying your identity with Login.gov](https://login.gov/help/verify-your-identity/how-to-verify-your-identity/){.usa-link--external}. 

### If you delete your Login.gov account

If you don’t have access to your [Login.gov authentication methods](https://login.gov/help/get-started/authentication-methods/){.usa-link--external}, you may be advised to [delete your Login.gov account](https://www.login.gov/help/manage-your-account/delete-your-account/){.usa-link--external}. This will cause you to lose access to your domains. To regain access to your domains, create a new Login.gov account and then email <help@get.gov> using your registrar email address. 

## Change your password

Access to the .gov registrar is managed through Login.gov. You can [change your password at Login.gov](https://www.login.gov/help/manage-your-account/change-your-password/){.usa-link--external}.

## Update your contact information (email, phone)

Updating your contact information for one domain will update the contact information for all domains in the registrar. However, it won’t affect your Login.gov account information.

The contact information you provide won’t be made public and will only be used for the .gov program.

1. Sign in to the [.gov registrar](https://manage.get.gov){target="_blank"} using your Login.gov account.
3. Click the “Manage” link for your .gov domain.
4. Click “Your contact information” on the left-side navigation.
5. Update your contact information.
6. Click “Save.”
