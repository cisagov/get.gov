## Access the .gov registrar

### New registrar requires Login.gov account

In November 2023, we launched a new .gov registrar. You must have a Login.gov account to request or manage domains in this new registrar. Login.gov provides a simple and secure process for signing into many government services with one account. 

### If you had an account in the old .gov registrar

If you had a .gov account prior to November 2023, you can’t use your old credentials to access the new registrar. You’ll need to create a Login.gov account and provide the same email address you used to log in to the old registrar. That will ensure your domains are linked to your Login.gov account. 
If you need help finding the email address you used in the past, [contact us](../../contact/).

## Get help with your Login.gov account

### How to create a Login.gov account

Follow these steps to [create your Login.gov account](https://login.gov/help/get-started/create-your-account/){.usa-link--external}.

### You must verify your identity with Login.gov

We require you to verify your identity with Login.gov. This is an extra layer of security that requires you to prove you are you, and not someone pretending to be you. 

Not all government services that use Login.gov require this type of verification, but you only need to do it once and it will apply to all government services that require it. Read more about [verifying your identity with Login.gov](https://login.gov/help/verify-your-identity/how-to-verify-your-identity/){.usa-link--external}. 

### If you already have a Login.gov account

If you already have a Login.gov account, you can use that account to sign in to the .gov registrar. We’ll prompt you to verify your identity with Login.gov if you haven’t already done so. 

## Update your username and password

Access to the .gov registrar is managed through Login.gov. To update your username and password, you’ll need to do that through your Login.gov account. Follow these steps to [update your username and password](https://www.login.gov/help/manage-your-account/change-your-password/){.usa-link--external}.

## Update your contact information (email, phone)

Updating your contact information for one domain will update the contact information for all domains in your account. However, it won’t affect your Login.gov account information.

The contact information you provide won’t be made public and will only be used for the .gov program.

1. Sign in to the [.gov registrar](https://manage.get.gov){target="_blank"} using your Login.gov account.
3. Click the “Manage” link for your .gov domain.
4. Click “Your contact information” on the left-side navigation.
5. Update your contact information.
6. Click “Save.”
