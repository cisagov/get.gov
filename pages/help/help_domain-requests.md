## Request your .gov domain
If you’re ready to request your .gov domain, then get started. You don’t have to complete the process in one session. You can save what you enter and come back to it when you’re ready.

## Before you request your .gov domain

You must be a government employee, or be working on behalf of the government, to request a .gov domain. 

Follow these steps to complete your request as quickly as possible.{.checklist}

- **Eligibility**: [Make sure your organization is eligible to have a .gov domain](../../domains/eligibility/).
- **Domain name**: [Choose an available .gov domain that complies with our requirements](../../domains/choosing/).
- **Authorizing official**: [Find out who your authorizing official is](../../domains/eligibility/#you-must-have-approval-from-an-authorizing-official-within-your-organization) and make sure they approve your request.
- **Request form**: Gather [all the information you’ll need](../../domains/before/#information-you’ll-need-to-complete-the-domain-request-form) to complete your domain request.
- **Account**: [Create a Login.gov account](https://login.gov/help/get-started/create-your-account/){.usa-link--external}. You’ll need that account to request a .gov domain. Login.gov provides a simple and secure process for signing in to many government services with one account.

### First-time domain requestors must verify their identity with Login.gov

Before you can request your first .gov domain, we’ll require you to verify your identity with Login.gov. This is a necessary layer of security that requires you to prove you are you, and not someone pretending to be you. You’ll need a state-issued ID, a Social Security number, and a phone number for identity verification. You’ll be prompted to verify your identity when you begin the domain request process.

## Change a domain request you already submitted

To make changes to your domain request, you have to withdraw it first. Changing your request may extend the time it takes for the .gov team to complete their review.

Follow these steps to make changes. 

1. Sign in to the [.gov registrar](https://manage.get.gov){target="_blank"} using your Login.gov account.
2. Click the “Manage” link for the domain request you want to withdraw.
3. Click the “Withdraw request” button.
4. Confirm that you want to withdraw your request. This will take you back to the domain dashboard.
5. Click the “Edit” link next to your withdrawn request.
6. Go to the section of the request you want to change. 
7. Make your changes and submit the request.

You will receive an email notification that confirms your request has been submitted. 

## Check the status of your domain request

You can check the status of your domain request at any time. Sign in to the [.gov registrar](https://manage.get.gov){target="_blank"} using your Login.gov account. The status of your request will be displayed within the “Domain requests” table. 
    
The statuses for domain requests are:
- **Started**: Your domain request has been started.
- **Submitted**: Your domain request has been completed and submitted.
- **In review**: Your domain request is being reviewed by the .gov team.
- **Action needed**: The .gov team has a question about your request or needs more information to move forward with their review. They will reach out to you with more details.
- **Withdrawn**: Your domain request has been withdrawn and will not be reviewed by the .gov team. In this status, you have the option to edit and resubmit the request.
- **Approved**: Your domain request has been approved. Before the domain can be used, you’ll need to add name servers.
- **Rejected**: Your domain request has been rejected. In this status, you have the option to withdraw the request, which will allow you to edit and resubmit it.


## Withdraw your domain request
    
You can withdraw your domain request after you submit it. Withdrawing your request means that the .gov team will not review your domain request. 

Follow these steps to withdraw your domain request.

1. Sign in to the [.gov registrar](https://manage.get.gov){target="_blank"} using your Login.gov account.
2. Click the “Manage” link for the domain request you want to withdraw.
3. Click the “Withdraw request” button.
4. Confirm that you want to withdraw your request. This will take you back to the domain dashboard. 
  
You will receive an email notification that confirms your request has been withdrawn.
