5. Click the “Edit” link next to your withdrawn request.
6. Go to the section of the request you want to change. 
7. Make your changes and submit the request.

You will receive an email notification that confirms your request has been submitted. 

## Check the status of your domain request

You can check the status of your domain request at any time. Sign in to the [.gov registrar](https://manage.get.gov){target="_blank"} using your Login.gov account. The status of your domain request will be on this page under “Domain requests.”
