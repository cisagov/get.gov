### Eligibility: make sure your organization is eligible to have a .gov domain

Government organizations at all levels are eligible for .gov domains. These include:

{% include 'content-blocks/org_types.md' %}

After you request a .gov domain, we'll review the information you provided about your organization. We use the [U.S. Census Bureau’s criteria for classifying governments](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/gus/technical-documentation/methodology/population-of-interest1.html) to help determine eligibility. In some cases, we'll request more information (such as legislation, a charter, or bylaws) to verify eligibility.

### Domain name: choose a .gov domain name that complies with our naming requirements

#### .Gov domain names must be available, unique, and clear

Your domain name represents your organization and your services to the world online. Good domain names are memorable, easy to say out loud (like over the phone or in a presentation), and must follow the general naming requirements and specific rules for your type of organization.

While internet domain names must be unique, names of government organizations can be similar or even identical. Our domain naming rules aim to prevent confusion.

.gov domains must:
- Be available 
- Be unique
- Relate to your organization’s name, location, and/or services
- Be clear to the general public. Your domain name must not be easily confused with other organizations.

#### Only federal agencies can request generic terms
Only federal agencies can request generic terms like vote.gov or benefits.gov.
That said, we can approve domains with generic terms, like marylandvotes.gov, because it references a location and a service.


#### Things to avoid in .gov domain names
Avoid using the following in your .gov domain name:
- Dashes or hyphens
- Numbers
- Misspellings

See [domain name requirements and domain examples for different types of organizations]({{'../../domains/choosing/'}}).

### Authorizing official: find out who your authorizing official is and make sure they approve your request

You must have approval from an authorizing official within your organization to request a .gov domain. Your authorizing official is the person within your organization who can:

- Approve your domain request
- Attest to your organization’s eligibility for a .gov domain

While authorizing officials vary between types of organizations, this is generally the highest-ranking or highest-elected official. When you request a .gov domain, we'll ask for information about your authorizing official (role, contact information). We’ll check with your authorizing official to make sure they approve your request. 

Authorizing officials will generally have administrative autonomy in an organization. Examples of appropriate roles include:

- Mayor
- Chair or executive director
- Chief administrative official (city or town manager, chief administrative officer)
- Senior technology official (chief information officer, chief information security officer)

See [examples of authorizing officials for different types of organizations]({{'../../domains/eligibility/#you-must-have-approval-from-an-authorizing-official-within-your-organization'}}).

### Request form: gather the information needed to complete the request form

We’ll ask you questions about your organization and the domain you want. Here’s what you’ll need to know to complete the form. 

- Type of government organization you represent
- Organization name and mailing address
- Name, role, and contact information for your authorizing official
- Purpose of the .gov domain
- Current website for your organization (if you have one)
- .Gov domain you want
- Other employees from your organization

### Account: create a Login.gov account

You need a [Login.gov](https://login.gov/) account to request a .gov domain. Login.gov provides a simple and secure process for signing into many government services with one account.
