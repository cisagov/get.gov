  title: Roles & permissions
---

Enterprise mode brings centralized control and transparency to your organization's domain management. Org admins can add members to your organization, then manage their access by assigning them roles and permissions that streamline operations and keep your org's domains secure.

Enterprise mode offers the following roles:

- An **org admin** has full permissions to see all registered domains and manage members’ roles and permissions.
- Most people in an organization will be **basic members**, a customizable role that allows them to be assigned specific permissions by an org admin.

## View and manage members

Org admins can invite or remove members and manage their permissions. Basic members who have been granted the additional permission to "view all member permissions" can view, but not edit or add, members of the organization.

### Add a new organization admin

Only org admins can add additional org admins.

1. Sign in to the [.gov registrar](https://manage.get.gov/) using your Login.gov account.  
2. Click the “Members” link in the top navigation bar.  
3. Click the “Add a new member” button.  
4. Enter the new member’s email address.  
5. Set their role as “Admin.”  
6. Click “Invite member” to add the user to your organization. You’ll see a summary of the user’s information and permissions.  
7. Click “Yes, invite member.”

### Add a new basic member

Org admins can add new organization members. Basic members who have been granted the additional permission to "view all member permissions" can view, but not edit or add, members of the organization.

1. Sign in to the [.gov registrar](https://manage.get.gov/) using your Login.gov account.  
2. Click the “Members” link in the top navigation bar.  
3. Click the “Add a new member” button.  
4. Enter the new member’s email address.  
5. Set their role as “Basic.”  
6. By default, basic members can only view domains that they manage, and have no access to requests of members. These options are pre-selected, but you can change these permissions for the member:  
   1. **Domains:** Choose whether to allow the user to view all domains in your organization or just the domains they manage.  
   2. **Domain requests:** Choose whether to allow the user to view all requests for your organization or submit new requests.  
   3. **Members:** Choose whether the user can view all member permissions.   
7. Click “Invite member” to add the user to your organization. You’ll see a summary of the user’s information and permissions.  
8. Click “Yes, invite member.”

**Note:** You cannot invite a member who is already a member of another .gov organization. We will offer users the ability to be part of multiple organizations, and switch between them, in late 2025.

### Manage existing members

Only org admins can manage organization members. Basic members who have been granted the additional permission to "view all member permissions" can view, but not edit, members of the organization.

1. Sign in to the [.gov registrar](https://manage.get.gov/) using your Login.gov account.  
2. Click the “Members” link in the top navigation bar.  
3. Click “Manage” next to the member entry you want to view or update. (Members who are org admins will have an “Admin” tag beside their email address.)  
4. View the member’s permissions and make any necessary changes. Then click “Review.”  
5. You’ll see a summary of the member’s permissions. Click “Apply changes.”

### Remove a member or cancel an invitation

1. Sign in to the [.gov registrar](https://manage.get.gov/) using your Login.gov account.  
2. Click the “Members” link in the top navigation bar.  
3. Find the member entry you want to view or update. (Members who are org admins will have an “Admin” tag beside their email address.)  
4. Click the three dots beside the “Manage” link to view “More options.”  
5. Click “Remove member” or “Cancel invitation.”

### Manage domain assignments for a member

Only org admins can manage domain assignments. Basic members who have been granted the additional permission to "view all member permissions" can view, but not edit, domain assignments.

1. Sign in to the [.gov registrar](https://manage.get.gov/) using your Login.gov account.  
2. Click the “Members” link in the top navigation bar.  
3. Find the user and click the “Manage” link to view their profile.  
4. On the user profile page, scroll down to “Domain assignments.”  
5. Click the “Edit domain assignments” button. You’ll see all the domains for your organization.  
6. Select the domains you want to assign to the member.  
7. Click “Review” to see a summary of your changes.  
8. If everything looks good, click “Apply changes.”

All domains must have at least one domain manager. If the user is the only manager for a domain, you won’t be able to unassign them from that domain. Assign another domain manager first before unassigning the original domain manager.
