Enterprise mode brings centralized control to your organization's domain management. Org admins can add members to your organization and manage their access through assigned roles, helping keep your domains secure.

Enterprise mode offers the following roles:

- An **organization (org) admin** has full permissions to see all registered domains and manage members’ roles and permissions.
- The **basic member** role by default only allows someone to manage specific domains they've been assigned to manage. The role is customizable, though, and allows an org admin to assign additional permissions as well.

## View and manage members

Org admins can invite or remove members and manage their permissions. Basic members who have been granted the additional permission to "view all member permissions" can view members of the organization, but not edit or manage members.

### Add a new organization admin

Only existing organization admins can add additional org admins.

1. Sign in to the [.gov registrar](https://manage.get.gov/) using your Login.gov account.  
2. In the top navigation bar, click “Members”. On the Members page, click the button “Add a new member”.  
3. Enter the new member’s email address and set their role as "Admin", then click "Invite member".
4. After reviewing a summary of the user's information and permissions, click "Yes, invite member".

### Add a new basic member

Org admins can add new organization members. Basic members who have been granted the additional permission to "view all member permissions" can view members of the organization, but not edit or manage members.

1. Sign in to the [.gov registrar](https://manage.get.gov/) using your Login.gov account.  
2. Click the “Members” link in the top navigation bar. On the Members page, click the button “Add a new member”.  
3. Enter the new member’s email address and set their role as "Basic". 
4. Basic members can only view domains that they manage, and not domain requests or member information. These permissions are pre-selected, but you can update these permissions, if desired:
   1. **Domains:** Allow the user to view all domains in your organization or just the domains they manage (default).  
   2. **Domain requests:** Allow the user to view all requests for your organization, view all requests and submit new requests, or have no access to domain requests (default).  
   3. **Members:** Allow the user to view all member permissions, or no access (default). If a user needs to modify organization members, they should be added as an [org admin](#add-a-new-organization-admin) instead.   
5. Click “Invite member” to add the user to your organization. You’ll see a summary of the user’s information and permissions.  
6. Click “Yes, invite member.”

**Note:** You cannot invite a member who is already a member of another .gov organization. We will offer users the ability to be part of multiple organizations, and switch between them, in late 2025.

### Manage existing members

Only org admins can manage organization members, including editing their permissions. Basic members who have been granted the additional permission to "view all member permissions" can view members of the organization, but not edit, add, or remove other members.

1. Sign in to the [.gov registrar](https://manage.get.gov/) using your Login.gov account.  
2. Click the “Members” link in the top navigation bar.  
3. Click “Manage” next to the member entry you want to view or update. (Members who are org admins will have an “Admin” tag beside their email address.)  
4. View the member’s permissions and make any necessary changes. Then click “Review.”  
5. You’ll see a summary of the member’s permissions. Click “Apply changes.”

### Remove a member or cancel an invitation

1. Sign in to the [.gov registrar](https://manage.get.gov/) using your Login.gov account.  
2. Click the “Members” link in the top navigation bar.  
3. Find the member entry you want to view or update. (Members who are org admins will have an “Admin” tag beside their email address.)  
4. Click the three dots beside the “Manage” link to view “More options.”  
5. Click “Remove member” or “Cancel invitation.”

### Manage domain assignments for a member

Only org admins can manage domain assignments. Basic members who have been granted the additional permission to "view all member permissions" can view, but not edit, domain assignments.

1. Sign in to the [.gov registrar](https://manage.get.gov/) using your Login.gov account.  
2. Click the “Members” link in the top navigation bar.  
3. Find the user and click the “Manage” link to view their profile. On the user profile page, scroll down to “Domain assignments.”  
4. Click the “Edit domain assignments” button. You’ll see all the domains for your organization.  
5. Select the domains you want to assign to the member. Click “Review” to see a summary of changes.  
6. If everything looks good, click “Apply changes.”

All domains must have at least one domain manager. If the user is the only manager for a domain, you won’t be able to unassign them from that domain. Assign another domain manager first before unassigning the original domain manager.
