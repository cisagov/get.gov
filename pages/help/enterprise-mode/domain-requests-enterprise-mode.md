# **Requesting a domain in enterprise mode**

To request a .gov domain in enterprise mode, you must be an organization admin or a designated requestor. Learn more about roles and permissions in enterprise mode.

## Completing the request form might take 15 minutes

If you have your Login.gov account and have gathered all the information you need, completing your domain request might take around 15 minutes. The process for requesting a .gov domain in enterprise mode is made simpler by the fact that many of your organization’s details are pre-filled.

## Requesting entity

First, we’ll ask you to specify whether the requested domain will be used by your overarching organization or one of its suborganizations. If you're requesting a domain for a new suborganization, you'll need to provide the name of the organization, city, and state.

## .Gov domain you want

Here’s the part where you’ll tell us the .gov domain you want. We’ll try to give you your preferred domain, but we first need to make sure it meets our requirements. We’ll work with you to find the best domain for your organization.

Your domain name must:

* Be available  
* Relate to your organization’s name, location, and/or services  
* Be unlikely to mislead or confuse the general public (even if your domain is only intended for a specific audience)

Names that *uniquely apply to your organization* are likely to be approved over names that could also apply to other organizations.

Requests for your organization’s initials or an abbreviated name might not be approved, but we encourage you to request the name you want.

Read more about [our domain name requirements](/domains/choosing/).

## **Purpose of your domain**

We’ll ask you to explain how you plan to use your .gov domain. Will you use it for a website and/or email? Read about what you can and cannot do with a .gov domain on [Requirements for operating a .gov domain](/domains/requirements/). 

**Additional details for federal agencies and election offices**

If you're requesting a domain for an election office or a federal executive branch agency, your request will require additional information and may be subject to a special approval process. Learn more about these details and the domain naming requirements you'll need to follow on [.Gov for executive branch federal agencies](/domains/executive-branch-guidance/) and [.Gov for election offices](/domains/election-offices/).

## **What happens after you request your .gov domain**

We’ll review your request. This review period usually takes around 10 business days. 

During our review we’ll verify thatyour requested domain meets our naming requirements. 

If your domain is approved, we’ll ask you to provide the following information:

* Domain name server information (required)  
* Additional domain managers  
* Security email for public use

Before your approved .gov domain can be used, you’ll need to connect it to your DNS hosting service. **At this time, we don’t provide DNS hosting services**.

## **Start your domain request**

If you’re ready to request your .gov domain, then let’s get started. You don’t have to complete the process in one session. You can save what you enter and come back to it when you’re ready.
