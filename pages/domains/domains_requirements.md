  title: Requirements for operating .gov domains
---
The .gov domain space exists to support a broad diversity of government missions. Generally, we don’t examine how government organizations use their domains. However, misuse of a .gov domain can reflect upon the integrity of the entire .gov space. There are categories of misuse that are statutorily prohibited or abusive in nature.


## What you can’t do with .gov domains

### Commercial purposes
.Gov domains must not be used for commercial purposes, such as advertising that benefits private individuals or entities.

### Political campaigns
.Gov domain must not be used for political campaigns. 

### Illegal content
.Gov domains must not be used to distribute or promote material whose distribution violates applicable law.

### Malicious cyber activity
.Gov is a trusted and safe space. .Gov domains must not distribute malware, host open redirects, or engage in malicious cyber activity.


## What .gov domain registrants must do

### Keep your contact information updated
.Gov domain registrants must maintain accurate contact information in the .gov registrar. 

### Be responsive if we contact you
Registrants should respond promptly to communications about potential violations to these requirements.


## Failure to comply with these requirements could result in domain suspension or termination
We may need to suspend or terminate a domain registration for violations. When we discover a violation, we’ll make reasonable efforts to contact a registrant, including:
- Emails to domain contacts
- Phone calls to domain contacts
- Email or phone call to the authorizing official
- Emails or phone calls to the government organization, a parent organization, or affiliated entities

We understand the critical importance of the availability of .gov domains. Suspending or terminating a .gov domain is reserved for prolonged, unresolved, serious violations where the registrant is non-responsive. We'll make extensive efforts to contact registrants and to identify potential solutions. We'll make reasonable accommodations for remediation timelines based on the severity of the issue.
