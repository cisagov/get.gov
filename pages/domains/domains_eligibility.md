## Only verified U.S. government organizations can register and operate a .gov domain
Anyone can register top-level domains like .com, .org, or .us for a fee. .Gov domains are different. .Gov domains are only available to governments in the U.S., and they’re free.

The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) manages the .gov top-level domain. We verify the identity of everyone who requests a .gov domain and we make sure that their organization meets the criteria for having a .gov domain.


## Government organizations at all levels are eligible for .gov domains
If you’re eligible to have a .gov domain we want you to get one. The types of government organizations eligible for .gov domains include:
- **Federal**: an agency of the U.S. government's executive, legislative, or judicial branches
- **Interstate**: an organization of two or more states
- **State or territory**: one of the 50 U.S. states, the District of Columbia, American Samoa, Guam, Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico, or the U.S. Virgin Islands
- **Tribal**: a tribal government recognized by the federal or a state government
- **County**: a county, parish, or borough
- **City**: a city, town, township, village, etc.
- **Special district**: an independent organization within a single state
- **School district**: a school district that is not part of a local government


## How we determine eligibility
After you request a .gov domain, we'll review the information you provided about your organization. We use the [U.S. Census Bureau’s criteria for classifying governments](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/gus/technical-documentation/methodology/population-of-interest1.html) to help determine eligibility. In some cases, we'll request more information (such as legislation, a charter, or bylaws) to verify eligibility.


## You must have approval from an authorizing official within your organization
Your authorizing official is the person within your organization who can:
- Approve your domain request
- Attest to your organization’s eligibility for a .gov domain

While authorizing officials vary between types of organizations, this is generally the highest-ranking or highest-elected official. Your official must have executive responsibility. When you request a .gov domain, we'll ask for information about your authorizing official (role, contact information). If needed, we'll ask for a different authorizer than the one first submitted.

Authorizing officials will generally have administrative autonomy in an organization. Examples of appropriate roles include:
- Mayor
- Chair or executive director
- Chief administrative official (city or town manager, chief administrative officer)
- Senior technology official (chief information officer, chief information security officer)
