## Only verified U.S. government organizations can register and operate a .gov domain
For a fee, anyone can register a .com, .org, or .us domain. .Gov domains are different because they’re only available to U.S.-based government organizations, and they’re free.

The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) manages the .gov top-level domain. We verify the identity of everyone who requests a .gov domain and we make sure that their organization meets the criteria for having a .gov domain.


## Government organizations at all levels are eligible for .gov domains
If you’re eligible to have a .gov domain, we want you to get one. The types of government organizations eligible for .gov domains include:

## How we determine eligibility
After you request a .gov domain, we'll review the information you provided about your organization. We use the [U.S. Census Bureau’s criteria for classifying governments](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/gus/technical-documentation/methodology/population-of-interest1.html){.usa-link--external} to help determine eligibility. In some cases, we’ll ask for more information (such as legislation, a charter, or bylaws) to verify eligibility.


## You must have approval from an authorizing official within your organization
Your authorizing official is a person within your organization who can authorize your domain request. This person must be in a role of significant, executive responsibility within the organization.

When you request a .gov domain, we’ll ask for information about your authorizing official (role, contact information). We typically don’t reach out to them, but if contact is necessary, our practice is to coordinate first with you, the requestor.
