## What’s in a name?
Your domain name represents your organization and your services to the world online. Good domain names are memorable and easy to say out loud, like over the phone or in a presentation.

The names of government organizations across the nation can be similar or even identical, so our domain naming rules aim to prevent confusion. Names that *uniquely apply to your organization* are likely to be approved over names that could also apply to other organizations. In most instances, this requires including your state’s two-letter abbreviation in the domain name.

We recommend against using dashes and numbers in a domain name because they can be hard to interpret when heard out loud and are often forgotten when typed.
