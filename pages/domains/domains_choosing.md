  title: Choosing your .gov domain name
---



## .Gov domain names must be unique and clear
Your domain name represents your organization and your services to the world online. Good domain names are memorable, easy to say out loud (like over the phone or in a presentation). .Gov domain names must follow the naming requirements for your type of organization.

While internet domain names must be unique, names of government organizations can be similar or even identical. Our domain naming rules aim to prevent confusion.

## Only federal agencies can request generic terms
Only federal agencies can request generic terms like vote.gov or benefits.gov.

That said, we can approve domains with generic terms, like marylandvotes.gov, because it references a location and a service.


## Things to avoid in .gov domain names
Avoid using the following in your .gov domain name:
- Dashes or hyphens
- Numbers
- Misspellings

State .gov domains must include the two-letter state abbreviation or clearly spell out the state name. 

Examples:

### Tribal governments
Tribal governments recognized by the federal or a state government.

Tribal domains may include the suffix -nsn, for native sovereign nation.

Examples:

- pitu.gov
- TulalipTribalCourt-nsn.gov

### Counties
This organization type includes counties, parishes, or boroughs.

Most county .gov domains must include the two-letter state abbreviation or the full state name. County names that aren’t shared by any other city, county, parish, town, borough, village or equivalent in the U.S., at the time a domain is granted, can be requested without referring to the state. Counties can include “county” in their domain to distinguish it from other places with similar names. We use the [Census Bureau’s National Places Gazetteer Files](https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/time-series/geo/gazetteer-files.html){.usa-link--external} to determine if county names are unique.

Examples:
- AdamsCountyMS.gov
- LivingstonParishLA.gov
- MitchellCountyNC.gov
- Erie.gov

### Cities
This organization type includes cities, towns, townships, villages, etc.

Most city domains must include the two-letter state abbreviation or clearly spell out the state name unless city or county exceptions apply. Using phrases like “City of” or “Town of” is optional.

Some cities don’t have to refer to their state.

- City names that aren't shared by any other U.S. city, town, or village can be requested without referring to the state. We use the [Census Bureau’s National Places Gazetteer Files](https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/time-series/geo/gazetteer-files.html){.usa-link--external} to determine if names are unique.

- Certain cities are so well-known that they may not require a state reference to communicate location. We use the list of U.S. “dateline cities” in the Associated Press Stylebook to make this determination.

- The 50 largest cities, as measured by population according to the Census Bureau, can have .gov domain names that don’t refer to their state.

Examples:
- CityofEudoraKS.gov
- WallaWallaWA.gov
- Pocatello.gov
- nyc.gov

### Special districts
These are independent organizations within a single state.

Domain names must represent your organization or institutional name, not solely the services you provide. It also needs to include your two-letter state abbreviation or clearly spell out the state name unless city or county exceptions apply.

Examples:
- ElectionsShelbyTN.gov
- GlacierViewFire.gov
- HVcoVote.gov
- TechshareTX.gov
- UtahTrust.gov

### School districts
School districts that aren’t part of a local government are eligible for .gov domains.

Domain names must represent your organization or institutional name.
