  title: Choosing your .gov domain name
---



## .gov domain names must be unique and clear
Your domain name represents your organization and your services to the world online. Good domain names are memorable, easy to say out loud (like over the phone or in a presentation), and must follow the general naming requirements and specific rules for your type of organization.

While internet domain names must be unique, names of government organizations can be similar or even identical. Our domain naming rules aim to prevent confusion.

.gov domains must:
- Be available
- Be unique
- Relate to your organization’s name, location, and/or services
- Be clear to the general public. Your domain name must not be easily confused with other organizations.


## Only federal agencies can request generic terms
Only federal agencies can request generic terms like vote&#46;gov or benefits&#46;gov.
That said, we can approve domains with generic terms, like marylandvotes&#46;gov, because it references a location and a service.


## Things to avoid in .gov domain names
Avoid using the following in your .gov domain name:
- Dashes or hyphens
- Numbers
- Misspellings


## Domain name requirements and guidance for specific organizations
Read domain name requirements and guidance for:
- [U.S. states and territories](#domain-names-for-u.s.-states-and-territories)
- [Tribal governments](#domain-names-for-tribal-governments)
- [Counties](#domain-names-for-counties)
- [Cities](#domain-names-for-cities)
- [Special districts](#domain-names-for-special-districts)
- [School districts](#domain-names-for-school-districts)

### Domain names for U.S. states and territories
State .gov domains must include the two-letter state abbreviation or clearly spell out the state name.

Examples:
- AmericanSamoa&#46;gov
- Coloradog&#46;gov
- Georgia&#46;gov
- Guam&#46;gov

### Domain names for tribal governments
Tribal domains may include the suffix -nsn, for native sovereign nation.

Examples:
- tbyi&#46;gov
- pitu&#46;gov
- TulalipTribalCourt-nsn&#46;gov

### Domain names for counties
Most county .gov domains must include the two-letter state abbreviation or the full state name. County names that aren’t shared by any other county, parish, or borough in the U.S. can be requested without referring to the state. We use the [Census Bureau’s National Places Gazetteer Files](https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/time-series/geo/gazetteer-files.html) to determine if county names are unique.

Examples:
- AdamsCountyMS&#46;gov
- LivingstonParishLA&#46;gov
- MitchellCountyNC&#46;gov
- Erie&#46;gov

### Domain names for cities
Most city domains must include the two-letter state abbreviation or clearly spell out the state name. Using phrases like “City of” or “Town of” is optional.

Examples:
- CityofEudoraKS&#46;gov
- WallaWallaWA&#46;gov
- Pocatello&#46;gov

Some cities don’t have to refer to their state.

- City names that are not shared by any other U.S. city, town, or village can be requested without referring to the state. We use the Census Bureau’s National Places Gazetteer Files to determine if names are unique.

- Certain cities are so well-known that they may not require a state reference to communicate location. We use the list of U.S. “dateline cities” in the Associated Press Stylebook to make this determination.

- The 50 largest cities, as measured by population according to the Census Bureau, can have .gov domain names that don’t refer to their state.

### Domain names for special districts
Domain names must represent your organization or institutional name, not solely the services you provide.

Examples:
- ElectionsShelbyTN&#46;gov
- HVcoVote&#46;gov
- TechshareTX&#46;gov
- UtahTrust&#46;gov

### Domain names for school districts
Domain names must represent your organization or institutional name.
- mckinneyISDTX&#46;gov
