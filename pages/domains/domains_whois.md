WHOIS (pronounced “who is”) is a standard used by registrars to publish the contact and name server information for registered domains.

This is a web version of our WHOIS, which you can also access in a command-line interface application like Terminal ($ whois -g get.gov).

Search for a .gov domain to get information about who manages it and other registry details. You can also view [this data in bulk](../../about/data/).
