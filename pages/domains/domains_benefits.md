## .Gov helps the public identify official, trusted information

.Gov is a top-level domain like .com, .org, or .us. .Gov is a top-level domain like .com, .org, or .us. For a fee, anyone can register popular top-level domains like .com or .org. This can make it hard for the public to know whether the people behind an online service are really who they claim to be.

## Only verified U.S. government organizations can register a .gov domain 

It should be easy to identify governments on the internet. Using a .gov domain shows you’re official. The public shouldn’t have to guess whether the site they’re on, or the email in their inbox, is genuine.

CISA, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, manages the .gov top-level domain. .Gov is available only to U.S.-based government organizations. We verify the identity of everyone who requests a .gov domain and we validate that their organization meets the criteria for having a .gov domain.

## .Gov domains are free

.Gov domains are available to eligible organizations for free! 

## Organizations at all levels of government are eligible for .gov domains

Cities, towns, counties, election boards, states, tribal governments, courts, and more are eligible for .gov domains. 

Only U.S.-based government organizations are eligible for .gov domains. This includes any federal, state, local, or territorial government entity, or other publicly controlled entity. It also includes any tribal government recognized by the federal government or a state government. We use the [U.S. Census Bureau’s criteria for classifying governments](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/gus/technical-documentation/methodology/population-of-interest1.html) to help us determine eligibility.

## .Gov domains are critical infrastructure for governments at all levels

.Gov domains support access to public services. We make .gov a trusted, secure space by:
- Using multi-factor authentication for all accounts in our domain registration and management system
- Preloading all new domains. This action requires browsers to use a secure HTTPS connection with your website. This ensures that the content you publish is exactly what your visitors get.
- Administering our [domain requirements](domains_requirements.md) to protect the integrity of .gov
- Publishing the [complete list of .gov domains](#)
- Recommending [security best practices](#) for .gov domain holders
- Continuously improving how we secure the .gov namespace
