  title: Before you request a .gov domain
---

To get a .gov domain, you need to submit a request using our online form. We only evaluate requests submitted by authorized requesters from government organizations that meet our [eligibility requirements](https://get.gov/domains/eligibility/).

* **Non-federal organizations**: Requesters must be a government employee or work on behalf of the government in a technological, administrative, or executive capacity.
* **Federal organizations**: These agencies limit who can submit requests on their behalf. Federal employees should coordinate with their CIO office to obtain the appropriate permissions.

If you have important deadlines to meet, plan ahead and start the request process as soon as possible. Completing our request form might take 15 minutes, but it may take several weeks to be evaluated by our team. Requests from officials in a senior role (e.g., a CIO, a city manager) may be processed faster.

The guidance below is meant to help you understand the process and navigate it efficiently.

## What happens after you request your .gov domain

We’ll review your request. This review period usually takes around 10 business days.

During our review we’ll verify that:
- Your organization is eligible for a .gov domain
- You work at the organization and/or can make requests on its behalf 
- Your requested domain meets our naming requirements 

After your domain is approved, we’ll ask you to provide the following information:
- Domain name server information (required)
- Additional domain managers
- Security email for public use

Before your approved .gov domain can be used, you’ll need to connect it to your DNS hosting service. **At this time, we don’t provide DNS hosting services.**
