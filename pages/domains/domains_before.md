  title: Before you request a .gov domain
---

You must be a government employee, or be working on behalf of the government, to request a .gov domain. 

If you’re ready to request your domain then let’s get started. You don’t have to complete the process in one session. You can save what you enter and come back to it when you’re ready. 

Start a .gov domain request{.usa-button}

## Purpose of the domain request form

We’ll use the information you provide to verify your organization’s eligibility for a .gov domain. We’ll also verify that the domain you request meets our guidelines. 

## Steps to take before you request your .gov domain

{% include 'content-blocks/before-you-request-steps.md' %}

{% include 'content-blocks/login-verify-identity.md' %}

## Completing the request form might take 15 minutes

If you have your Login.gov account and have gathered all the information you need, completing your domain request might take around 15 minutes.

## You can request one domain per online service

For non-federal agencies, we generally approve one domain per online service per government organization. We'll evaluate additional requests on a case-by-case basis.

You don’t need to defensively register variations of your domain name. While this practice may be common when registering domains open to the general public, the .gov domain space is not first come, first serve. We'll only assign a domain to the organization whose real name or services actually correspond to the domain name.

## Information you’ll need to complete the domain request form

We’ll ask you questions about your organization and the domain you want. Here’s what you’ll need to know to complete the form. There’s more information about each of these sections below.

{% include 'content-blocks/information_needed_for_domain_request.md' %}

### Type of government organization you represent

You’ll choose from the list below. 

{% include 'content-blocks/org_types.md' %}

### Organization name and mailing address

We’ll ask you the name and mailing address for the organization you represent. Your organization might be part of a larger entity. If so, enter the name of your part of the larger entity. 

If your domain request is approved, the name of your organization and your city/state will be listed in [.gov’s public data](../../about/data/).

### Your authorizing official

Your authorizing official is a person within your organization who can authorize your domain request. This person must be in a role of significant, executive responsibility within the organization. Read more about [who can serve as an authorizing official](../eligibility/#you-must-have-approval-from-an-authorizing-official-within-your-organization).

What we’ll need to know about your authorizing official:
- Name
- Role in your organization
- Email address

We typically don’t reach out to the authorizing official, but if contact is necessary, our practice is to coordinate with you, the requestor, first. 

### Current websites for your organization

We’ll ask about your organization’s current public websites. We can better evaluate your domain request if we know about domains you’re already using. If you already have a .gov domain, include that in your list.

### .Gov domain you want

Here’s the part where you’ll tell us the .gov domain you want. We’ll try to give you your preferred domain, but we first need to make sure it meets our requirements. We’ll work with you to find the best domain for your organization.

{% include 'content-blocks/general_domain_requirements.md' %}

Read more about [our domain name requirements](../choosing/).

### Purpose of your domain

We’ll ask you to explain how you plan to use your .gov domain. Will you use it for a website and/or email? Read about [activities that are prohibited on a .gov domain](../requirements/).

### Your contact information
We’ll ask you to provide your contact information. While reviewing your domain request, we may need to reach out with questions. We’ll also email you when we complete our review.

Your contact information won’t be made public and will be used only for .gov purposes.

### Other employees from your organization

To help us determine your organization’s eligibility for a .gov domain, it’s helpful to have contact information for other employees from your organization.

- They should be clearly and publicly affiliated with your organization and familiar with your domain request. 
- They don’t need to be involved with the technical management of your domain (although they can be).
- **We typically don’t reach out to these employees**, but if contact is necessary, our practice is to coordinate with you first.

## What happens after you request your .gov domain

We’ll review your request. This usually takes 20 business days. During this review we’ll verify that:
- Your organization is eligible for a .gov domain
- You work at the organization and/or can make requests on its behalf 
- Your requested domain meets our naming requirements 

After your domain is approved, we’ll ask you to provide the following information:
- Domain name server information (required)
- Additional domain managers
- Security email for public use

Before your approved .gov domain can be used, you’ll need to connect it to your DNS hosting service. **At this time, we don’t provide DNS hosting services.**
