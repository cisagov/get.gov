  title: Before you request a .gov domain
---

You must be a government employee, or be working on behalf of the government, to request a .gov domain. 

If you’re ready to request your domain then let’s get started. You don’t have to complete the process in one session. You can save what you enter and come back to it when you’re ready.

## Purpose of the domain request form

We’ll use the information you provide to verify your organization’s eligibility for a .gov domain. We'll also verify that the domain you request meets our guidelines. 

## Steps to take before you request your .gov domain

Complete your request as quickly as possible by taking these actions.{.checklist}

- **Eligibility**: [Make sure your organization is eligible to have a .gov domain](../eligibility/).
- **Domain name**: [Choose an available .gov domain that complies with our requirements](../choosing/).
- **Authorizing official**: [Find out who your authorizing official is](../eligibility/#you-must-have-approval-from-an-authorizing-official-within-your-organization) and make sure they approve your request.
- **Request form**: Gather [all the information you’ll need](#information-you’ll-need-to-complete-the-domain-request-form) to complete your domain request.
- **Account**: [Create a Login.gov account](https://login.gov/help/get-started/create-your-account/){.usa-link--external}. You’ll need a Login.gov account to request a .gov domain. [Login.gov](https://login.gov/){.usa-link--external} provides a simple and secure process for signing into many government services with one account.

## Completing the request form might take 15 minutes

If you have your [Login.gov](https://login.gov/){.usa-link--external} account and have gathered all the information you need, completing your domain request might take around 15 minutes.


## Information you’ll need to complete the domain request form

We’ll ask you questions about your organization and the domain you want. Here’s what you’ll need to know to complete the form. There’s more information about each of these sections below.

{% include 'content-blocks/information_needed_for_domain_request.md' %}

### Type of government organization you represent

You’ll choose from the list below. 

{% include 'content-blocks/org_types.md' %}

### Organization name and mailing address

We’ll ask you the name and mailing address for the organization you represent. Your organization might be part of a larger entity. If so, enter information about your part of the larger entity. Once your domain is approved, the name of your organization will be publicly listed as the domain registrant.

### Authorizing official

Your authorizing official is the person within your organization who can authorize your domain request. This is generally the highest-ranking or highest-elected official in your organization. [Read more about who can serve as an authorizing official](../eligibility/#you-must-have-approval-from-an-authorizing-official-within-your-organization).

What we’ll need to know about your authorizing official:
- Name
- Role in your organization
- Email address
- Phone number

After you submit your request, we’ll contact your authorizing official to double check that they approve it.

### Purpose of the .gov domain

We’ll ask you to explain how you plan to use your .gov domain. Will you use it for a website and/or email? Are you moving your website from another top-level domain (like .com or .org)? Read about [activities that are prohibited on .gov domains](../requirements/#what-you-can%E2%80%99t-do-with-.gov-domains).

### Current website for your organization

We’ll ask about your organization’s current public website. We can better evaluate your domain request if we know about domains you’re using. If you already have any .gov domains please include them.

### .Gov domain you want

Here’s the part where you’ll tell us the .gov domain you want. We’ll try to give you your preferred domain. We first need to make sure your request meets our requirements. We’ll work with you to find the best domain for your organization.

{% include 'content-blocks/general_domain_requirements.md' %}

[Read more about our domain name requirements](../requirements/).

### Other employees from your organization

We’d like to contact other employees in your organization about your domain request. For example, they could be involved in managing your organization or its technical infrastructure. This information will help us assess your eligibility for a .gov domain. These contacts should be in addition to you and your authorizing official. They should be employees of your organization.

## What happens after you request your .gov domain

We’ll review your request. This usually takes 20 business days. During this review we’ll verify that your:
- Organization is eligible for a .gov domain
- Authorizing official approves your request
- Domain meets our naming requirements

Once your domain is approved we’ll ask you for information about:
- Points of contact who will help manage your domain
- Security email for public use
- Domain name server information

### More about domain name servers

A name server is a server within the Domain Name System (DNS) that answers queries about a domain name. DNS is the internet service that translates your domain name into an IP address. This makes it possible for people to access your online service by using a name instead of a numbered address.

Before your approved .gov domain can be used, you’ll need to connect it to your DNS hosting service. At this time, we don’t provide DNS hosting services. We manage the authoritative name servers for the .gov zone.
