We’ll share notes about product releases and new features here.

## January 31, 2024

Today we launched a new way to get a .gov domain. You’re reading this on our new [get.gov](https://get.gov) site. The purpose of this site is to help eligible government organizations get and manage .gov domains.

### We made it easier to request a .gov domain

Our old domain request process required a signature, typically from the senior elected or highest-ranking official in a government organization. This led to unnecessary delays for many organizations. **The new request process is fully digital**, doesn’t require a physical signature, and can usually be approved by someone with significant, executive responsibility in your organization, like a senior technology officer or chief administrative official.

### We’re using Login.gov for authentication and identity verification

Login.gov provides a simple and secure process for signing in to many government services with one account. We require you to verify your identity with Login.gov **before you can request your first .gov domain**. [Create your Login.gov account](https://login.gov/help/get-started/create-your-account/){.usa-link--external}. Read more about [verifying your identity with Login.gov](https://login.gov/help/verify-your-identity/how-to-verify-your-identity/){.usa-link--external}. 

### We improved this site to help you request and manage your .gov domain

Check out the site and [let us know what you think](https://forms.office.com/g/Uq30UkMYRu). Here are a few places to start.

- [How to move to .gov from another domain](../../domains/moving/)
- [Steps to take before you request a .gov domain](../../domains/before/)

### Domain management updates

- Domain expiration date: As we reported in November, we extended expiration dates for .gov domains in good standing for one year. Domain managers can now see the expiration dates for their domains.
- Organization address: Your organization's mailing address information is now in the new registrar.
- Domain managers can’t remove another user’s access without contacting us, but this feature is coming soon!


## November 17, 2023

Our new domain management system—the .gov registrar—is now available. We’ve transferred organization, contacts, and domain name system (DNS) information for all .gov domains to the new registrar.

[Let us know](https://forms.office.com/g/Uq30UkMYRu) if you have questions or concerns about the information you see for your domain.

### Changes from the previous registrar

- We no longer have the admin, technical, and billing roles. In the new registrar, these roles are all considered "domain managers." You can add an unlimited number of domain managers. 
- We’re now using [Login.gov]((https://login.gov/){.usa-link--external} to manage access to the registrar. Login.gov is a simple and secure process for signing in to many government services with one account.

### Some domain information won’t immediately be available in the registrar

- Domain expiration date: Good news! We have extended expiration dates for .gov domains in good standing for one year.
- Organization address: We have not yet transferred your organization's mailing address to the new registrar. There is a place to save that information in the new registrar, but it is empty for now.

### Domain management features that aren’t enabled yet

- Email notifications aren’t sent for domain information changes (like a change to your contact information).
- A change history for domain information isn’t available.
- Domain managers can’t remove another user’s access without contacting us.
