The .gov program at the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) is a team of program managers, technologists, and analysts. We help U.S. government organizations gain public trust by making .gov a well-known, reliable, and secure space online.

The .gov top-level domain (TLD) is only available to U.S.-based government organizations and publicly controlled entities. The .gov team has a direct impact on the security of thousands of online services relied on by federal, state, tribal, territorial, and local governments throughout the United States – and their millions of users. 

We help shape how governments manage and secure their DNS infrastructure, how the .gov registry authenticates and authorizes registrant organizations and domains, and how CISA maintains insight into a trusted and trustworthy namespace for governments.
