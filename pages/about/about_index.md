## Who we are

We are a team of passionate designers, developers, and product people. We help U.S.-based government organizations gain public trust by making .gov a well-known, reliable, and secure space online.

The .gov program is part of the [Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency](https://www.cisa.gov/). 

Check out [job openings on our team](jobs).

## What we do

The .gov team manages the .gov top-level domain.

### .Gov domain name registration

We manage domain name registration for .gov. We are the .gov registrar. (A registrar manages domain name registration.) You can only request and register .gov domain names through us. We make it easy for eligible government organizations to register .gov domains. We verify the identity and eligibility of everyone who requests a .gov domain.

### Authoritative source for all .gov domain names and registrants

We manage the authoritative record of all .gov domain names and their registrants. We are the .gov registry. (A registry contains domain names and registrant information for a top-level domain.) We ensure that .gov domain names resolve in the global domain name system (DNS). DNS maps easy-to-remember names to hard-to-recall numbers. For example, this allows us to use “cisa.gov” instead of something like “104.106.178.124.”

### Critical infrastructure for governments at all levels

.Gov domains are critical to providing access to public services. We make .gov a trusted, secure space by:

- Using multi-factor authentication for all accounts in our domain registration and management system
- Preloading all new domains. This action requires browsers to use a secure HTTPS connection with your website. This ensures that the content you publish is exactly what your visitors get.
- Administering our [domain requirements](../domains/requirements) to protect the integrity of .gov
- Publishing the [complete list of .gov domains](data)
- Recommending [security best practices](../domains/security/) for .gov domain holders
- Securing the .gov namespace with ongoing improvements
