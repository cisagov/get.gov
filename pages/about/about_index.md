## Who we are

We are the .gov registry. We're a team of designers, developers, and product people. We help government organizations in the U.S. gain public trust by making .gov a well-known, reliable, and secure space online. The .gov registry is part of the [Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency](https://www.cisa.gov/).

## What we do

We manage the .gov domain registry. This includes the .gov registrar.

- A **registry** contains domain names and registrant information for a top-level domain (like .gov, .com, or .us).
- A **registrar** manages domain name registration.

### We are the authoritative source for all .gov domain names and registrants {.h4}

We manage the authoritative record of all .gov domain names and their registrants. We ensure that .gov domain names resolve in the global domain name system (DNS). DNS maps easy-to-remember names to hard-to-recall numbers. For example, this allows us to use “cisa.gov” instead of something like “104.106.178.124.”

### We manage .gov domain name registration {.h4}

We manage domain name registration for .gov. You can only request and register .gov domain names through the .gov registrar. We make it easy for eligible government organizations to register .gov domains. We verify the identity and eligibility of everyone who requests a .gov domain.

### We provide critical infrastructure for governments at all levels {.h4}

.Gov domains are critical to providing access to public services. We make .gov a trusted, secure space by:

- Using multi-factor authentication for all accounts in our domain registration and management system
- Preloading all new domains. This action requires browsers to use a secure HTTPS connection with your website. This ensures that the content you publish is exactly what your visitors get.
- Administering our [domain requirements](../domains/requirements) to protect the integrity of .gov
- Publishing the [complete list of .gov domains](data)
- Recommending [security best practices](../domains/security/) for .gov domain holders
- Securing the .gov namespace with ongoing improvements
