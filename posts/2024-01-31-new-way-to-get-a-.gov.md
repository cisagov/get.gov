## U.S.-based government organizations can once again request .gov domains

We’re excited to announce that there is a new way to get a .gov domain. You’re reading this on our new [get.gov](https://get.gov) site. The purpose of this site is to help eligible government organizations get and manage .gov domains. Some highlights:

- [Eligibility for .gov domains](../../domains/eligibility/)
- [Why you should use .gov](../../domains/benefits/)
- [How to move to .gov from another domain](../../domains/moving/)
- [Steps to take before you request a .gov domain](../../domains/before/)

## New process makes it easier to request a .gov

Government organizations at all levels in the U.S. are eligible for .gov domains. This includes cities, towns, counties, election offices, states, tribal governments, courts, federal agencies, and more. 

Our old domain request process required a signature, typically from the senior elected or highest-ranking official in your organization. For many organizations, these requirements led to unnecessary bureaucracy that caused delays. 

**The new request process is fully digital**, doesn’t require a physical signature, and can usually be approved by someone with significant, executive responsibility in your organization, like a senior technology officer or chief administrative official.

### Now using Login.gov for authentication and identity verification

Login.gov provides a simple and secure process for signing in to many government services with one account. 

We require you to verify your identity with Login.gov **before you can request your first .gov domain**. This is a necessary layer of security that requires you to prove you are you, and not someone pretending to be you. You’ll need a state-issued identification (ID), a Social Security number, and a phone number for identity verification.

## Manage your .gov domain

In November 2023, we launched a new registrar and shared a [summary of the new domain management features](../../about/product/#november-17%2C-2023). If you already have a .gov, you can [manage DNS information, domain contacts, and more](../../help/domain-management/). 

A few recent updates:

- Domain managers can add other users without our help.
- Domain expiration dates are displayed in the domain dashboard.

We’re excited to continue making things better! You can follow our progress at <https://github.com/cisagov/manage.get.gov>{.usa-link--external}.
