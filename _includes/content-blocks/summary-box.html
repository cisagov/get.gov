        Naming requirements for all organization types
      </h2>
      <p>Your requested domain name must meet the <a class="usa-link" href="#naming-requirements-for-specific-organization-types">requirements of your organization type</a>, 
        and:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Be available. </strong>If it's already registered, you can't request it.</li>
            <li><strong>Clearly relate to your organization's name, location, and/or services. </strong>Generic terms are reserved for federal agencies. Requests for your organization's initials alone may not be approved.</li>
            <li><strong>Be unlikely to mislead or confuse the general public, even if you're only targeting a specific audience. </strong>In practice, this means most domains must include a state's name (abbreviated or full) and may need additional identifiers (like "county", "township", or "tribe"). We do not typically approve domains that are shorter than 6 characters.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We generally do not approve more than one domain per organization
        (including naming variations). We also wilt not approve domains for internal
        or non-internet use.</p>
