      Naming requirements for all organization types
    </h2>
    <p>
      Your requested domain name must meet the <a class="usa-link" href="#naming-requirements-for-specific-organization-types">requirements of your organization type</a>, and:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="#domain-availability-form"><strong>Be available.</strong></a> If it's already registered, you can't request it.</li>
      <li><strong>Clearly relate to your organization's name, location, and/or services.</strong> Generic terms are reserved for federal agencies. Requests for your organization's initials alone may not be approved.</li>
      <li><strong>Be unlikely to mislead or confuse the general public,</strong> even if you're only targeting a specific audience.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      We generally do not approve more than one domain per organization
      (including naming variations).
