Your domain name must:

- Be available [(Check availability)](../../#domain-input)
- Relate to your organization’s name, location, and/or services
- Be clear to the general public. Your domain name must not be easily confused with other organizations.

Names that <em>uniquely apply to your organization</em> are likely to be approved over names that could also apply to other organizations. 

Requests for your organization’s initials or an abbreviated name might not be approved, but we encourage you to request the name you want.
