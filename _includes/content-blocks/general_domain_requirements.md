Your domain name must:

- Be available [(Check availability)](https://beta.get.gov/)
- Relate to your organization’s name, location, and/or services
- Be clear to the general public. Your domain name must not be easily confused with other organizations.

Names that <em>uniquely apply to your organization</em> are likely to be approved over names that could also apply to other organizations. In most instances, this requires including your state’s two-letter abbreviation. 

Requests for your organization’s <em>initials or an abbreviated name</em> might not be approved, but we encourage you to request the name you want.
