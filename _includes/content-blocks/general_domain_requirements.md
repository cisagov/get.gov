Your domain name must:

- Be available
- Relate to your organization’s name, location, and/or services
- Be unlikely to mislead or confuse the general public (even if your domain is only intended for a specific audience)

Names that <em>uniquely apply to your organization</em> are likely to be approved over names that could also apply to other organizations. 

Requests for your organization’s initials or an abbreviated name might not be approved, but we encourage you to request the name you want.
